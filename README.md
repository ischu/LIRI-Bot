# LIRI-Bot
### Purpose

Look out, Siri, there's a new bot-assistant in town- LIRI! 

Just like Siri, LIRI can perform searches for the user. However, instead of searching for what the user says aloud, LIRI takes the user's search via the command line. 

### Using LIRI bot

The user will begin by entering <node> and then <liri> followed by a command and a search query.

LIRI will then log the results to the console in an easy-to-read format.

### Commands

LIRI bot knows four commands:
  1. Use "spotify-this-song" to return data about songs from Spotify

  2. Use "movie-this" to return data about a movie from OMDB

  3. Use "concert-this" to return data about upcoming concerts by an artist

  4. Use "do-what-it-says" to let LIRI-bot decide what data to return!
